This repository contains examples that demonstrate basic Python ability. 
Each folder demonstrates different skills. 

A1: A basic word counting script is written. The functions written allow users to read in text from a file and search for words. The occurences of each word is reported to the user in a neat and user-friendly format. These functions can accept edge cases such as missing words, words with hyphens or non-alphanumeric cases, integers, and others. 

A2: Demonstrates ability to read data in from a spreadsheet and perform cleaning tasks using Pandas. Part two investigates the memory and storage use of various algorithms, and demonstrates how to write modular code, using classes. Visualisations are used to explore relationships between time and memory usage of algorithms.

A3:
